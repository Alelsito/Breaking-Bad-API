## Overview

### The challenge

1. Create a page where you can consult the characters of Breaking-Bad
2. Read information about each character that is displayed.

Such as:
- Name
- Ocupation
- Nickname
- Appearance
- Portrayed
- Status

3. Have a favorites list with the characters that the user will choose by clicking on the cards.
    - Options to eliminate all the elements, the first element (**Stack**) of the list and the last element (**Queue**) (*Linear Data Structures*).

### How to use it

1. At first, displayed on the page you can see a navigation bar and also the full list of characters.

- The functioning of the navigation bar contains the following options:
    1. Dropdown to search characters by seasons (*1, 2, 3, 4, 5*)*
    2. Refresh the page (*by clicking on the Breaking-Bad logo*)
    3. Dropdown to search characters by status (*alive, deceased, unknown*)
    4. Dropdown to eliminate character(s) of the favorites list
        * All elements
        * First element (*stack*)
        * Last element (*Queue*)
    5. Search characters by name or nickname

2. By clicking on a character card, the heart icon on it will be colorized green as a sign that it has been introduced to the favorites list.
3. By clicking again on the character card, the heart icon on it will return at his initial state (uncolored) as a sign that it has been eliminated of the favorites list.
